pulls food from database to create order.  
creates order as a map, (does not persist it to the database)
rather than adding / subtracting items, updates total items ordered.
no login 

to do: 
	update price formats in order summary
	persist orders to database
	insert order currently returns incorrect order number, not the key.  
	
	
	create report of all orders
	make login / employee user to pull report

would be nice: 
	format menu as columns for readability
